üß† What is Convolution?
Convolution is a mathematical operation used in image processing and deep learning ‚Äî especially in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

In simple terms, convolution is like scanning an image with a small filter (called a kernel) to detect specific features such as:

Edges,

Lines,

Textures,

Patterns, etc.

üîç How Does It Work?
You have an image (e.g., a 5x5 matrix of pixel values).

You have a small filter (usually 3x3), also filled with numbers.

The filter slides over the image, position by position.

At each position, it multiplies corresponding elements and adds them up ‚Äî that result becomes a pixel in a new output image.
