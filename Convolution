🧠 What is Convolution?
Convolution is a mathematical operation used in image processing and deep learning — especially in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

In simple terms, convolution is like scanning an image with a small filter (called a kernel) to detect specific features such as:

Edges,

Lines,

Textures,

Patterns, etc.

🔍 How Does It Work?
You have an image (e.g., a 5x5 matrix of pixel values).

You have a small filter (usually 3x3), also filled with numbers.

The filter slides over the image, position by position.

At each position, it multiplies corresponding elements and adds them up — that result becomes a pixel in a new output image.
